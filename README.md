# langchain_llm_rag

This project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and LangChain to process and interact with documents efficiently using large language models (LLMs). It involves splitting and embedding documents into formats that LLMs can efficiently read and interpret. It utilizes LLM from IBM watsonx.ai
